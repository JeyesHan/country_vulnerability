# country_vulnerability<br>
The solution to Problem E of MCM in 2018.<br>
An evaluation model of State Vulnerability using nerual networks(Pytorch implementation).<br>

Functional description
----
I have selected 12 indicators such as GDP, CPI, temperature and precipitation to evaluate the vulnerability of a country. <br>The training data set comes from World Bank statistics.<br>Therefore,by collecting a country's performance on these 12 indicators, we can judge the country's vulnerability.<br>
I use the data of 168 countries in 2016 to train neural networks. <br>After my training, the model has performed very well and is able to fit the data in the data set. <br>I used the data of 2017 to test the network and the network showed a good generalization ability.The training and testing data is saved in the csv format in the ./scripts/data folder.<br>

What can you do with it?
----
1、Predicting national vulnerability through the value of indicators<br>
2、Analyze the impact of certain indicators on the vulnerability of the country<br>
3、Learning data reading, model building, and fitting other functions<br>
4、And anything you like...<br>
